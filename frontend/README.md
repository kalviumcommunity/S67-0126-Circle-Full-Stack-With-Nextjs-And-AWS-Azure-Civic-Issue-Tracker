- Home Page → Static Rendering (SSG)
- Citizen Dashboard → Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Public Grievance Feed → Hybrid Rendering (ISR)

SSG improves accessibility and awareness.
SSR ensures real-time accountability.
ISR enables transparent public oversight at scale.

Like a news portal, fully static grievances become outdated,
while fully SSR systems are expensive.

Our solution uses ISR to balance freshness and scalability.

With 10x more users, SSR would be limited to dashboards only,
while public pages would rely on ISR to reduce cost and load.
